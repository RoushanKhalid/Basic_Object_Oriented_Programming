# Basic Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java. The code examples were created while following the **Apna College** tutorials, providing hands-on practice for fundamental OOP principles.

## Features

- **Abstraction**: Understanding abstract classes and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrating parent-child relationships in classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Exploring method overloading and overriding.
- **Encapsulation**: Implementing private attributes with getter and setter methods.
- **Constructors**: Covering all types of constructors in Java.
- **Static Keyword**: Understanding static members and methods in Java.

## File Structure

The repository is organized into individual files for each OOP concept, making it easy to find and understand specific examples:
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Inheritance Examples**
- **Encapsulation Examples**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Constructors** and more.

## Usage

Clone the repository to explore the examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Basic_Object_Oriented_Programming.git
